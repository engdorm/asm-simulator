## asm-simulator
MIPS assembly code simulation in Python

# Use:
To run assembly:
- Write instructions as a string, separated by "\n", and initialize and Assembler object with that argument.
- Or, you can write the assembly line by line in a text file, and call Assembler with the file object

# Why?
We were interested in better understanding the way that assembly instructions and pseudo-instructions work, separate from their machines.
